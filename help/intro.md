Launching Grist
---------------
Launch Grist by clicking the application icon or double-clicking a **.grist** file. The Start
page lists Grist documents in your local Documents directory. If you're launching Grist for the
first time, it will likely be empty. Let's change that by [creating a new
document](#creating-a-new-document).

Or, open a **.csv** or **.xls** file directly in Grist, by right-clicking the file in Finder and
selecting `Open With > Grist`. This will [import the file](imports.md) into a new Grist file
in your Documents directory.

Creating a new document
-----------------------
Once you've launched Grist, create and import new documents from the Start page.

`Create document` loads a new, empty document in the current window.

`Upload document` creates a new document from the selected a **.csv** or **.xls** file.

Opening an existing document
----------------------------
Click on a listed document to open it in the same window. To get back to the list open a new window
from the File menu (Command-N) or click on the Grist logo in the top-left corner.

file's containing folder.
