# Welcome to Grist! {: data-toc-label='' }

Grist is a software product to organize, analyze, and share data.

Grist combines the best of spreadsheets and databases. Even our name reflects this:
"Grist" is made of "grid" (as of spreadsheet cells) and "list" (as of database
records). Of course, real-world problems go beyond simple grids and lists, and
Grist is at its best when data gets more complex.

To learn Grist, we recommend starting with our How-To tutorials, or our
Intro videos.
