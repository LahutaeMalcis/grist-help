What is Grist?
--------------
Grist is a software product to organize, analyze, and share data. It is built with structured data
in mind.

The name Grist is a portmanteau combining `grid` (as of spreadsheet cells) and `list` (as of
database records). It is also an English word describing the useful part of grain, or more
generally, something useful or turned to advantage, as in "grist for one's mill." We see that
definition as aptly fitting, as Grist helps users extract meaning from their data.

Who is Grist for?
-----------------
Grist is designed as a general purpose tool for structured data. That said, we think it's particular
useful to individuals or teams trying to solve the following problems:

* Manage confusing spreadsheets that hold relational data
* Perform side-by-side reconciliation of disparate datasets
* Clean up and maintain clean data using validation rules
* Write Python against data you can see and manipulate
* Creating multiple views on top of the same underlying data
