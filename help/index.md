# Welcome to Grist! {: data-toc-label='' }

Grist is a software product to organize, analyze, and share data.

Grist combines the best of spreadsheets and databases. Our name reflects this mission:
"Grist" is made of "grid" (as of spreadsheet cells) and "list" (as of database
records). Beyond simple grids and lists, Grist is at its best when data gets
more complex, as it always does for real-world problems.

To learn Grist, we recommend starting with our "How-To" tutorials, or our "Getting Started" videos.
