To get started with Grist you'll first need to create a document.
Each document can store different kinds of data, so think of it as a
collection of *related* data.

You can start from scratch or import existing data. To do that, click
the Add New button on the home screen and choose either "Create empty document"
or "Import document".

You can import spreadsheets in Excel format, as well as comma-separated value
files or CSVs. If you import a spreadsheet that has multiple tabs, each tab
will become a separate table in Grist.

Once you've created a document, you can import more data into it by opening the
document and selecting "Add New" and then one of the Import options.
